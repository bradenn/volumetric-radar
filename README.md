# Volumetric Radar

This project aims to provide an advanced and precise object detection system using multiple custom radar devices. By combining the data from multiple radars, it generates a volumetric representation of the environment, enabling accurate detection of objects in 3D space.

The project is divided into the four following components:

    ├── client      # The web-app used to interact with either a single module or all through the bridge
    ├── firmware    # The programming run on the radar module iteself
    ├── hardware    # The pcb, enclosure, and radar module
    │   ├── pcb
    │   ├── enclosure
    │   └── radar
    └── bridge      # The software that unifies multiple modules into a single visualization

### Hardware
